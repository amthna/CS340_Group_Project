Project Outline
In-Flight Entertainment is a birding club including ~500 members from across the United States.
A database-driven web application will help the dispersed members keep abreast of migrational
patterns (and what their fellow bird watchers are observing) by allowing members to submit
records of birds they’ve identified. The database will serve to consolidate bird sightings and
provide birders with a way to view information on sightings of their favorite bird species at a
glance.
The app’s database backend will store information about bird species, birding locations, as well
as the members themselves. Locations will include information about public accessibility and
coordinates of locations. Contact information and club membership status will be stored for each
member (and former member).
Because sightings denote a single outing of birdwatching, and may include one or more
members as well as one or more bird species (although typically a sighting will be limited to one
or two birders), the database will be configured such that a single sighting can include many
birders and birds.
For this step of the project, we have normalized all data into 3NF.
